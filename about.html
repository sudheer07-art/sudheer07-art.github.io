                <p>People who choose to smoke and drink together do so as a way of life. Both habits might have a major negative impact on your body. These two habits are so intertwined that many people find it impossible to avoid them. It may even prove fatal if someone does it frequently. So, it is important to be aware of the health risks associated with drinking and smoking.
                Research on how tobacco and alcohol use interact to influence risk for cardiovascular disease is limited. Alcohol consumption of three or more drinks per day and cigarette smoking share similar, and probably additive, effects on some forms of cardiovascular disease. There is relatively little evidence, however, that the effects are worse when smoking and drinking occur together than would be expected from their independent effects. In most cases, moderate drinking does not share these risks and even has opposite effects of cigarette smoking on some risk factors. Ongoing public health efforts to minimize tobacco use and harmful drinking should result in clear and important gains to the nationâ€™s cardiovascular well-being.
                An extraordinary body of research has sought to understand the links between smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol, and an equally substantial body of evidence has demonstrated their synergy in causing cancer, birth defects, and other medical problems. In contrast, there generally has been little evidence that they interact to influence cardiovascular disease. Indeed, one recent review found only a single article that identified a probable interaction between alcohol and tobacco on risk of heart disease resulting from narrowing of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart (i.e., coronary heart disease) (Taylor and Rehm 2006). This article seeks to examine more broadly the ways that tobacco and alcohol may jointly affect risk of cardiovascular disease.
