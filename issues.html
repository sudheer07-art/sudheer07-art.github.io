                <p>Several factors complicate the interactions between tobacco and alcohol on cardiovascular disease.<br>

                 <b>First</b> dose matters. The relationship between smoking and risk of cardiovascular disease is dose dependent—more tobacco leads to more disease. For alcohol consumption, however, the issue is more complex. Most evidence suggests that consumption in the range of 3 to 14 drinks per week is associated with lower risk of heart attack (i.e., myocardial infarction) and possibly of other forms of cardiovascular disease, such as blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain, resulting in a deficiency in blood flow (i.e., ischemic stroke) or failure of the heart to pump blood sufficiently throughout the body (i.e., congestive heart failure). However, intake of three or more drinks per day clearly increases the risk of ischemic stroke, and heavier drinking may well increase the risk of myocardial infarction.<br>

<b>Second</b> cardiovascular disease encompasses a variety of conditions with a diverse set of causes or origins. Smoking is clearly linked to a higher risk of nearly all forms of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and bleeding into the brain (i.e., hemorrhagic stroke), congestive heart failure, and narrowing of the arteries in the extremities (i.e., peripheral arterial disease) (Burns 2003). The relationship between alcohol use and cardiovascular risk factors is not so clear. Moderate drinking has been associated with a consistently lower risk of myocardial infarction, but only a modestly lower risk of ischemic stroke, and a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Simply combining all of these conditions together as “cardiovascular disease” will tend to blur these distinctions.<br>

<b>Third</b> even those types of cardiovascular disease directly linked to the gradual build-up of fatty deposits (i.e., plaques) in the arteries, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, represent acute events superimposed on the background process of the gradual narrowing and hardening of the arteries (i.e., atherosclerosis). Atherosclerosis itself is dynamic and involves cholesterol transport into and out of cells in the blood vessel wall, the entry of inflammatory cells, and abnormal function of the cells lining the vessel surface (i.e., endothelial cells). The final trigger in this pathway is often a blood clot that forms at the site of a plaque whose cap has ruptured, exposing the blood to irritants within the plaque. Tobacco and alcohol use may have chronic effects on several steps in the gradual atherosclerotic process and more acute effects on the formation of blood clots that often trigger actual clinical events.<br>

<b>Fourth</b> and perhaps most difficult to address, is the nature of the relationship between alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking and how it bears on our understanding of each. In both experimental and observational studies of alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoking is treated as a confounder or nuisance parameter. That is, researchers recognize that smoking is common among drinkers and that it is a strong risk factor for heart disease that could cloud the true effect of alcohol consumption. Investigators typically study the effect of alcohol independent of smoking, either by mathematical adjustment or by examining smokers and nonsmokers separately. This approach implicitly views smoking and drinking as shared consequences of specific lifestyle or behavior patterns and ignores the possibility that alcohol consumption itself makes individuals more likely to smoke cigarettes (Shiffman and Balabanis 1995). If alcohol consumption itself leads to cigarette smoking to even some degree, then understanding the full effects of alcohol will require accounting for a difficult complexity—cigarette smoking among alcohol drinkers may be related both to shared lifestyle habits and to direct effects of alcohol. This complexity is equally important for studies of tobacco use, as they need to incorporate the possibility that smoking may lead to alcohol consumption (Madden et al. 2000). This issue will challenge researchers for the foreseeable future.
